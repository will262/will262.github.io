	    <p class="monospace"><b>Joel Embiid pours in 40 as Sixers pull even with Hawks
</b>
<br><br>

Joel Embiid scored a playoff-career-high 40 points and grabbed 13 rebounds Tuesday as the host Philadelphia 76ers evened their Eastern Conference semifinal series with a 118-102 victory over the Atlanta Hawks in Game 2.
<br><br>
Once again, Embiid was questionable to play shortly before tipoff due to a small lateral meniscus tear in his right knee.
<br><br>
Tobias Harris added 22 points and Seth Curry had 21, including five 3-pointers, for the Sixers. Shake Milton scored 14 points in 14 minutes off the bench.
<br><br>
Philadelphia's reserves were held scoreless in the first half but came through with 26 points in the second.
<br><br>
Trae Young put up 21 points and 11 assists for the Hawks. Danilo Gallinari had 21 points and nine rebounds, and Kevin Huerter added a playoff-career-high 20. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 14 points while Clint Capela had 10.
<br><br>
Hawks forward De'Andre Hunter missed his second straight game because of right knee soreness.
<br><br>
Game 3 in the best-of-seven series will be played Friday in Atlanta.
<br><br>
The Sixers came out strong and moved ahead 23-6. The Hawks stayed patient, chipped away and closed within 37-35 midway through the second quarter.
<br><br>
Embiid soon capped a 9-0 run with a short jumper in the lane and the Sixers led by 11 with 4:52 remaining in the half.
<br><br>
Gallinari dropped in a 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left and the Hawks trailed only 57-55 at halftime.
<br><br>
Harris scored 18 points before the break, and Embiid added 16 points but had three fouls by halftime. Huerter and Gallinari each had 15 first-half points for Atlanta.
<br><br>
When Embiid hit a trey from the wing with 7:12 to go in the third quarter, the Sixers led 73-63.
<br><br>
The Hawks mounted a rally and cut the deficit to 79-78 with 3:46 left in the third after a difficult 3-pointer by Bogdanovic. With just over two minutes left, the Hawks took their first lead at 80-79 after a pair of Young free throws.
<br><br>
Milton led a charge late in the third quarter, and sank a deep trey in the last second period as the Sixers took a 91-84 advantage.
<br><br>
Milton and Dwight Howard keyed a quick 11-0 spurt to open the fourth and the lead quickly was extended to 18. Milton capped the run with a 3-pointer that put the Sixers up 102-84 with 9:45 to go.
<br><br>
Atlanta's John Collins grabbed an offensive rebound and scored with 8:25 left to get the Hawks within 104-88. Collins finished with a team-high 10 rebounds.
<br><br>
The Hawks committed 18 turnovers that resulted in 28 Philadelphia points. Atlanta managed just seven points off nine Sixers giveaways, one game after Philadelphia turned it over 19 times.</p>

Donovan Mitchell pours in 45 as Jazz edge Clippers</b>
<br><br>



Donovan Mitchell scored 32 of his 45 points in the second half as the Utah Jazz rallied to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 112-109 Tuesday night in Salt Lake City to take a 1-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinals.
<br><br>
After the Jazz made a big comeback in the second half to take a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter -- after trailing by as many as 14 -- the Clippers rallied late to put themselves in a position to force overtime.
<br><br>
Utah's defense, however, denied them that opportunity. Rudy Gobert, the favorite to win a third Defensive Player of the Year award, blocked Marcus Morris' last-second 3-point attempt after the Jazz defense denied Kawhi Leonard and Paul George from getting a good look in the final 15 seconds.
<br><br>
The Jazz took the early series lead despite the absence of All-Star point guard Mike Conley, who was sidelined due to a strained right hamstring. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Thursday in Salt Lake City.
<br><br>
Along with Mitchell, Bojan Bogdanovic and Jordan Clarkson helped pick up the offensive slack for Utah with 18 points apiece. Joe Ingles added eight points with seven assists, while Mitchell also dished out five dimes.
<br><br>
Gobert finished with 10 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks, including the game-saver.
<br><br>
Leonard led the Clippers with 23 points and George added 20 points and 10 boards, but neither player shot well. Leonard made only 9 of 19 shots while George went 4-for-17. Luke Kennard played a big role in helping L.A. stay in the game despite its stars not shining as brightly as normal, coming off the bench to score 18 points.
<br><br>
The Jazz had five days of rest since defeating the Memphis Grizzlies 4-1 in the first round, and they looked rusty for much of the first half. Meanwhile, the Clippers were only two days removed from an emotional Game 7 win over the Dallas Mavericks, and they came out strong in the first two quarters.
<br><br>
With Jazz minority owner Dwyane Wade giving him pointers from the front row, Mitchell exploded in the third quarter to help Utah turn things around after the Clippers took a 60-47 halftime lead. Mitchell scored 16 points in the period, including the first 10 points for the Jazz, and helped Utah retake the lead at 72-71 on a fastbreak with a pass to Royce O'Neale.
<br><br>
The Jazz used back-to-back 3-pointers by Mitchell and Clarkson to take a six-point lead in the fourth quarter, eventually building it to 10.
<br><br>
The beginning of this series began as bizarrely as the Clippers' last series in which home teams lost the first six games. Utah jumped out to a 10-2 run and seemed to be fine without Conley. That didn't last long, though. The Jazz suffered an extended drought as the Clippers went on a 22-2 run to go up 24-12.
<br><br>
Utah ended up trailing 25-18 at the end of the first quarter after hitting just 5 of 28 shots.
<br><br>
The Clippers continued the pressure in the second quarter, taking a 13-point halftime lead thanks to some sizzling shooting from beyond the arc (11-for-23). L.A. held that big advantage despite a combined 3-of-13 shooting half by George and Leonard.
<br><br>
Kennard led the Clippers in first-half scoring with 11 points.
