</b>
<br><br>
Trae Young had 35 points and 10 assists and the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks upset the top-seeded and host Philadelphia 76ers 128-124 in the opening game of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Sunday afternoon.
<br><br>
John Collins and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 21 each and Kevin Huerter had 15 for the Hawks, who are competing in this playoff round for the first time in five years. Clint Capela also had 11 points and 10 rebounds.
<br><br>
Game 2 will be Tuesday night at Philadelphia.
<br><br>
Joel Embiid had been questionable to play with a small lateral meniscus tear in his right knee, but he finished with 39 points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots in 38 minutes.
<br><br>
Seth Curry added 21 points, Tobias Harris had 20 points and 10 rebounds and Ben Simmons chipped in with 17 points and 10 assists for the Sixers.
<br><br>
Atlanta made 20 of 47 shots from beyond the 3-point arc. It marked the most 3-pointers ever made against the 76ers in the playoffs.
<br><br>
The Hawks played without De'Andre Hunter, who sat out with right knee soreness.
<br><br>
The Hawks jumped out to a 42-27 lead at the end of the first quarter. They opened the second on a torrid pace as well and extended the advantage to 53-27 after a 3-pointer by Bogdanovic capped a 17-0 run.
<br><br>
Atlanta was still on top 74-54 at halftime thanks in large part to Young's 25 points.
<br><br>
Embiid paced the Sixers with 17. But they looked sloppy and disjointed on offense throughout and committed 12 turnovers in the first half, including nine in the first quarter.
<br><br>
The Sixers came out aggressive in the third and when Danny Green secured an offensive rebound and scored, they pulled within 79-64 with 8:44 left.
<br><br>
But the Hawks responded with a 10-0 spurt to go back ahead by 25.
<br><br>
After the Sixers cut the deficit to 14, Collins came back with a three-point play as the Hawks moved ahead 105-88 with 9:07 remaining.
<br><br>
Philadelphia managed to close within 118-111 with 1:41 to go after Curry dropped in a 3-pointer from the corner.
<br><br>
Embiid scored on the next two possessions and the deficit was suddenly three.
<br><br>
Bogdanovic then hit a trey and the Hawks moved back ahead by six.
<br><br>
The Sixers got within two in the waning seconds after a steal and dunk by Simmons before Bogdanovic made two free throws with 8.9 seconds left to seal it.

Kawhi Leonard, Clippers oust Luka Doncic, Mavs in Game 7 win</b>
<br><br>

Kawhi Leonard scored 28 points with 10 rebounds and nine assists as the Los Angeles Clippers used a balanced attack to defeat the visiting Dallas Mavericks 126-111 on Sunday in Game 7 of their NBA first-round playoff series.
<br><br>
Marcus Morris Sr. scored 23 points and Paul George added 22 points with 10 assists as the fourth-seeded Clippers advanced to the second round to face the Utah Jazz. Los Angeles became the sixth team in NBA history to lose the first two games of a series at home and still advance.
<br><br>
Sunday's game was the first time in the series the home team came out with the victory. It was the first time in NBA history the road team won the first six games of a postseason series.
<br><br>
Luka Doncic scored 46 points with 14 assists in his first career Game 7 of a playoff series but was unable to carry the Mavericks across the finish line. Dallas lost to the Clippers in the first round for the second consecutive season.
<br><br>
Dorian Finney-Smith scored 18 points with 10 rebounds and Kristaps Porzingis added 16 points with 11 rebounds for the Mavericks, who had two chances to close out the series. They lost at home 104-97 in Game 6 on Friday.
<br><br>
Trailing 81-76 with 6:53 remaining in the third quarter, the Clippers went on a 21-2 run to take a 97-83 lead, pushing the advantage to double digits for the first time in the game. They closed out the third quarter on an overall 24-4 run to take a 100-85 advantage.
<br><br>
Doncic was intent on getting to the second round when he scored 29 points in the first half on 10-of-14 shooting, including 4 of 6 from 3-point range. But he had just six points in the decisive third quarter and did not make any of his three 3-point attempts.
<br><br>
The Clippers pushed their advantage to as many as 19 at 106-87 with 9:20 remaining on a pair of Leonard free throws. The Mavericks made one last run, getting to within seven at 114-107 with 2:06 to play on a Doncic step-back 3-pointer.
<br><br>
But Reggie Jackson answered with a 3-pointer for a 117-107 lead and the Clippers finished off the game and series from there.
<br><br>
Jackson scored 15 points, while Terance Mann added 13 for the Clippers, who shot 50 percent from the field (41 of 82). Nicolas Batum and Luke Kennard added 11 points each.
<br><br>
Boban Marjanovic scored 14 points for the Mavericks with 10 rebounds, while Tim Hardaway Jr. had 11 points. The Mavericks got only six points from their bench, compared to 27 for the Clippers.
